## Overview

Our Solar System AR App utilizes augmented reality technology to bring the solar system to life. Users can point their device's camera at a marker image to trigger the AR experience. The app overlays detailed 3D models of planets, moons, and other celestial bodies onto the real-world environment captured by the camera. All 3D models used in this project are provided by NASA. Our Solar System AR App offers a fully functional simulation where all planets revolve around the Sun, and the Moon orbits the Earth. Users can study each planet individually by focusing on it, and relevant information about the selected planet will be displayed alongside the AR model. This interactive feature enhances the educational aspect of the app, allowing users to learn about the solar system while experiencing it in augmented reality.
